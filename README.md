I can code.

fuck you, that's why.



# But fr, who tf are you
Okay, to put it simply, I'm kind of a big deal. I can do basically everything that involves creativity.

- Art
- Programming
- Music
- Writing
- Gooning-

I am a linux-first developer, because I use arch btw. If you use windows, *then that's too dang bad!* 
(Dw, I will make windows ports for all of my programs, I'm not OSist. But don't expect them to be perfect.)

**Here's what I'm working on and planning on working on, that I might publish here.**
- My website on vercel
- A KDE Plasa theme entirely based on E621's interface (beta coming soon... hopefully :3)
- A KDE-oriented multipurpose DVD app that can let you watch, play, and burn dvds, and .
- Uhh... idk what else
